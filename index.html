        <h2 class="important">A Brief Introduction</h2>
            <p id="bio"><img src="img/brent-woodward-photo.jpg" align="right" />I am a 29 year old aspiring software developer who is currently studying at Code Fellows.  I have been married for almost 5 years to my amazing wife, Kristin, who is the greatest partner in life I ever could have hoped for.  I am a passionate problem solver and love to push myself to learn new things.  I believe that we each have the ability to make a difference in the world. By leveraging our understanding of technology we are able to expand the scope of that positive impact.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Support myself and my family with a career that I am passionate about.</li>
                <li>Make a difference in the work.  Whether it is through my career, my hobbies, or my community involvement.</li>
                <li>Go beyond just living life.  Discover new things to experience and see as much of the world as I can.</li>
